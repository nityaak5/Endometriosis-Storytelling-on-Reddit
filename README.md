Embracing the spectrum of emotions majorly ’negative,’ ’positive’ and ’fear’, we unveil expressions of struggles within the community. Our investigation extends to topic modeling, revealing five pivotal topics converging into three overarching classes. We use coherence scores as a means of evaluating the topic models created and finally discuss the major themes found within different topics.
